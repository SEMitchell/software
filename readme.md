# Software
## GUI Software/Platforms/Services

- **[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)** - makes using and syncing Github projects easier; Github can be a good place to (temporarily!) store data you're working with, publish websites, and collaborate with others
- **[Downthemall](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/)**(Firefox add on -- at the moment, it doesn't work with the newest version of Firefox) - allows you to bulk download images, pfs, videos from a page
- **[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)** - helps you develop an API call
- **[SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** - text editor that does a great job of showing errors in code - also can do regular expression searching across multiple open files
- **[Topic Modeling Tool](https://github.com/senderle/topic-modeling-tool)** - GUI that uses Mallet to create topic models
- **[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)**
- **[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html)**
- **[Voyant Server](https://github.com/sgsinclair/VoyantServer)**
- **[Gephi](https://gephi.org/)**
- **[Web Scraper](http://webscraper.io/)**(extension for Chrome Browser)

## Command Line Software
For Macs, the best way to install command line software is by first installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the instructions on the homepage. From there, most of the command line tools can be correctly installed using the protocol `brew install [toolname]`. You'll want to find the correct toolname from the tool's website.

- **[Gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org/)** (Windows only) - replaces Terminal for Windows users
- **[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr)** - OCR on images of text
- **[Stanford NER](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml)** (also works as a GUI) - will and mark up named entities (organizations, people, location, money, time, date, percent). You can use the [batchner script](https://github.com/brandontlocke/batchner) to do NER, count entities, and extract in one step.
- **[Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php)** software for topic modeling

## Other useful tools we didn't use
- **[wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)** - download (get) stuff from the web in bulk (images, sound files, etc.)
- **[xpdf](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html)** - open source PDF manipulation
- **[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** - manipulate multiple types of media (moving images, image, etc.)
- **[imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)** - manipulate images

## Additional Resources
- **[Sourcecaster](https://datapraxis.github.io/sourcecaster/)** - helps you use the command line to work through common challenges that come up when working with digital primary sources - note that there are expected dependencies
- **[Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/)** - this is a series of tutorials, many of which use command-line tools to accomplish common tasks
