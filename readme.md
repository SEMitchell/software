## Installing Command Line Software
For Macs, the best way to install command line software is by first installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the instructions on the homepage. From there, most of the command line tools can be correctly installed using the protocol `brew install [toolname]`. You'll want to find the correct toolname from the tool's website.
